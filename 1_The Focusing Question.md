THEORY:
1. Put all you eggs in one basket and then watch that basket
   Look around you and take notice
   Men who do that do not often fail
2. The secret of getting ahead is getting started
   The secret to getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one
3. Ask the most powerful question possible and the answer can be life altering

APPLIED:
1. What's the ONE thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?
2. It is of two parts:
	1. BIG PICTURE: What's my ONE thing?
	   (This gives you direction)
	2. SMALL FOCUS: What's my ONE thing right now?
	   (This leads to you first domino)

TIPS:
1. To stay on track for the best possible day, week, month and year and so on, you MUST keep asking the focusing question again and again as it FORCES you to line up tasks in their levered (most effective) order of importance

REMINDERS TO STICK ON WALL:
1. "What's the ONE thing I can do such that by doing it everything else is easier or unnecessary?"
	1. "What's my ONE thing?"
	2. "What's my ONE thing right now"
